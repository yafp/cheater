# About top
# top (table of processes) is a task manager program found in many Unix-like operating systems. 
# It produces an ordered list of running processes selected by user-specified criteria, and updates it periodically. 
# Default ordering is by CPU usage, and only the top CPU consumers are shown. 
# top shows how much processing power and memory are being used, as well as other information about the running processes. 
# Some versions of top allow extensive customization of the display, such as choice of columns or sorting method.
