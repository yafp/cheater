# About less
# less is a terminal pager program on Unix, Windows, and Unix-like systems used 
# to view (but not change) the contents of a text file one screen at a time. 
# It is similar to more, but has the extended capability of allowing both 
# forward and backward navigation through the file. 
# Unlike most Unix text editors/viewers, less does not need to read the entire 
# file before starting, resulting in faster load times with large files.

# To disable the terminal refresh when exiting
less -X

# To save the contents to a file
# Method 1 - Only works when the input is a pipe
s <filename>

# Method 2 - This should work whether input is a pipe or an ordinary file.
Type g or < (g or less-than) | $ (pipe then dollar) then cat > <filename> and Enter.
