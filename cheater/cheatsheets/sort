# About sort
# In Unix-like operating systems, sort is a standard command line program that prints the lines of its input or concatenation of all files listed in its argument list in sorted order. 
# Sorting is done based on one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input. By default, the entire input is taken as sort key. 
# Blank space is the default field separator.
