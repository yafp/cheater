# About rpm
# RPM Package Manager (RPM) (originally Red Hat Package Manager; now a recursive 
# acronym) is a package management system. 
# The name RPM refers to the following: the .rpm file format, files in the .rpm
# file format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager program 
# itself. 
# RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the 
# baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.
