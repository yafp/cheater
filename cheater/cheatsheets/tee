# About tee
# In computing, tee is a command in command-line interpreters (shells) using standard streams 
# which reads standard input and writes it to both standard output and one or more files, 
# effectively duplicating its input.
# It is primarily used in conjunction with pipes and filters. 
# The command is named after the T-splitter used in plumbing.
