# About php
# PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development
# but also used as a general-purpose programming language. 
# Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation
# is now produced by The PHP Development Team.
# PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the 
# recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
