# About gzip
# gzip is a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression. 
# The program was created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler as a free software replacement 
# for the compress program used in early Unix systems, and intended for use by GNU (the "g" is from "GNU").
