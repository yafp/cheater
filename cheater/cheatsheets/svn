# About svn
# Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after its command name svn) is a software versioning and revision control system distributed as open source under the Apache License. 
# Software developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. 
# Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS).
