# About rm
# rm (short for remove) is a basic UNIX command used to remove objects such as 
# files, directories, device nodes, symbolic links, and so on from the filesystem. 
# To be more precise, rm removes references to objects from the filesystem, 
# where those objects might have had multiple references (for example, a file 
# with two different names), and the objects themselves are discarded only 
# when all references have been removed and no programs still have open handles 
# to the objects.

# Ignore non existent files
rm -f path/to/the/target

# Remove a file with his inode
find /tmp/ -inum 6666 -exec rm -i '{}' \;
