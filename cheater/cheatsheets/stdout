# About stdout
# Standard output is the stream where a program writes its output data. 
# The program requests data transfer with the write operation. 
# Not all programs generate output. 
# For example, the file rename command (variously called mv, move, or ren) is silent on success.
# Unless redirected, standard output is the text terminal which initiated the program.
