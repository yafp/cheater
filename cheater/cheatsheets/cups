# About CUPS
# CUPS (formerly an acronym for Common UNIX Printing System) is a modular printing system for Unix-like computer operating systems 
# which allows a computer to act as a print server. 
# A computer running CUPS is a host that can accept print jobs from client computers, 
# process them, and send them to the appropriate printer.
