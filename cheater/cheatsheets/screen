# About screen
# GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer, a software application that can be used
# to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple
# separate login sessions inside a single terminal window, or detach and
# reattach sessions from a terminal. 
# It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface,
# and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started
# the program, particularly so a remote process continues running even when the
# user is disconnected.
