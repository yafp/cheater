# About patch
# The computer tool patch is a Unix program that updates text files according to
# instructions contained in a separate file, called a patch file. 
# The patch file (also called a patch for short) is a text file that consists
# of a list of differences and is produced by running the related diff program
# with the original and updated file as arguments.
# Updating files with patch is often referred to as applying the patch or 
# simply patching the files.
