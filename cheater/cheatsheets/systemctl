# About systemctl
# systemd is an init system used in Linux distributions to bootstrap the user space and manage all processes subsequently, instead of the UNIX System V or Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) init systems. 
# It is published as free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.
# The software has as one of its main goals the unification of basic Linux configurations and service behaviors across all distributions
