# About grep
# grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines 
# that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p 
# (globally search a regular expression and print), which has the same effect: 
# doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching 
# lines.

# Search a file for a pattern
grep pattern file

# Case insensitive search (with line numbers)
grep -in pattern file

# Recursively grep for string <pattern> in folder:
grep -R pattern folder

# Read search patterns from a file (one per line)
grep -f pattern_file file

# Find lines NOT containing pattern
grep -v pattern file

# You can grep with regular expressions
grep "^00" file  #Match lines starting with 00
grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" file  #Find IP add

# Find all files which match {pattern} in {directory}
# This will show: "file:line my research"
grep -rnw 'directory' -e "pattern"

# Exclude grep from your grepped output of ps.
# Add [] to the first letter. Ex: sshd -> [s]shd
ps aux | grep '[h]ttpd'

# Colour in red {bash} and keep all other lines
ps aux | grep -E --color 'bash|$'
