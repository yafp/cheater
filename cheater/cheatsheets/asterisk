# About asterisk
# Asterisk is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX); it allows attached telephones to make calls to one another, 
# and to connect to other telephone services, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. 
# Its name comes from the asterisk symbol, U+002A * ASTERISK.
