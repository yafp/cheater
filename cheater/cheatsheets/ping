# About ping
# ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. 
# It measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source. 
# The name comes from active sonar terminology that sends a pulse of sound and listens for the echo to detect objects under water, 
# although it is sometimes interpreted as a backronym to packet Internet groper.
