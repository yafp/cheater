# About cron/crontab
# The software utility Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. 
# People who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. 
# It typically automates system maintenance or administrationâ€”though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.
