# About sed
# sed (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using
# a simple, compact programming language. sed was developed from 1973 to 1974
# by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs, and is available today for most operating
# systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor
# ed ("editor", 1971) and the earlier qed ("quick editor", 1965â€“66).
# sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains
# in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command.
# Other options for doing "stream editing" include AWK and Perl.
