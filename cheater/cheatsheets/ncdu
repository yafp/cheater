# About ncdu
# ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) is a disk utility for Unix systems. Its name refers to its similar purpose to the du utility, 
# but ncdu uses a TUI under the [n]curses programming library. 
# Users can navigate the list using the arrow keys and delete files that are taking up too much space by pressing the 'd' key. 
# Version 1.09 and later can export the file listing in JSON format.
