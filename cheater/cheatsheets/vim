# About vim
# Vim is a clone of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. 
# It was written by Bram Moolenaar based on source for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and first released publicly in 1991. 
# Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. 
# Vim is free and open source software and is released under a license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda.
# The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License.

<Del> or x      delete a character
dd              delete a line
d{motion}       delete text that {motion} moves over

# Search and replace with the `:substitute` (aka `:s`) command

:s/foo/bar/	replace the first match of 'foo' with 'bar' on the current line only
:s/foo/bar/g	replace all matches (`g` flag) of 'foo' with 'bar' on the current line only
:%s/foo/bar/g	replace all matches of 'foo' with 'bar' in the entire file (`:%s`)
:%s/foo/bar/gc	ask to manually confirm (`c` flag) each replacement 

# Preceding a motion or edition with a number repeats it 'n' times
# Examples:
50k         moves 50 lines up
2dw         deletes 2 words
5yy         copies 5 lines
42G         go to line 42
