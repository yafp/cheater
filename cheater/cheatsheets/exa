# About exa
# exa is a modern replacement for ls. 
# It uses colours for information by default, helping you distinguish between many types of files, 
# such as whether you are the owner, or in the owning group. 
# It also has extra features not present in the original ls, such as viewing the Git status for a directory, 
# or recursing into directories with a tree view. exa is written in Rust, 
# so it’s small, fast, and portable.
