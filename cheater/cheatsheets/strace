# About strace
# strace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility for Linux. 
# It is used to monitor and tamper with interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state. 
# The operation of strace is made possible by the kernel feature known as ptrace.
