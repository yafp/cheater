# About ln
# The ln command is a standard Unix command utility used to create a hard link 
# or a symbolic link (symlink) to an existing file.
# The use of a hard link allows multiple filenames to be associated with the 
# same file since a hard link points to the inode of a given file, the data of 
# which is stored on disk. 
# On the other hand, symbolic links are special files that refer to other 
# files by name.

# To create a symlink:
ln -s path/to/the/target/directory name-of-symlink

# Symlink, while overwriting existing destination files
ln -sf /some/dir/exec /usr/bin/exec
