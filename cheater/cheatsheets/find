# About find
# In Unix-like and some other operating systems, find is a command-line utility that searches 
# one or more directory trees of a file system, locates files based on some user-specified criteria 
# and applies a user-specified action on each matched file. 
# The possible search criteria include a pattern to match against the filename or a time range to match against 
# the modification time or access time of the file. 
# By default, find returns a list of all files below the current working directory.
