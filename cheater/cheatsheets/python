# About python
# Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose 
# programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
# An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code 
# readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks 
# rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers 
# to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages 
# such as C++ or Java. 
# The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs 
# on both a small and large scale.
