# About netstat
# In computing, netstat (network statistics) is a command-line network utility tool that displays network connections for the Transmission Control Protocol (both incoming and outgoing), 
# routing tables, and a number of network interface (network interface controller or software-defined network interface) and network protocol statistics. 
# It is available on Unix-like operating systems including macOS, Linux, Solaris, and BSD, 
# and is available on Windows NT-based operating systems including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.
