# About ps
# In most Unix-like operating systems, the ps program (short for "process status") displays the currently-running processes. 
# A related Unix utility named top provides a real-time view of the running processes.
# In Windows PowerShell, ps is a predefined command alias for the Get-Process cmdlet, which essentially serves the same purpose.
