# About diff
# In computing, the diff utility is a data comparison tool that calculates and 
# displays the differences between two files. 
# Unlike edit distance notions used for other purposes, diff is line-oriented 
# rather than character-oriented, but it is like Levenshtein distance in that 
# it tries to determine the smallest set of deletions and insertions to create 
# one file from the other.
