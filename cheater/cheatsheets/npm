# About npm
# npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. 
# It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. 
# It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public packages, called the npm registry. 
# The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website.
