# About xargs
# xargs is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems used to build and execute command lines from standard input. 
# Commands such as grep and awk can accept the standard input as a parameter, or argument by using a pipe. 
# However, others such as cp and echo disregard the standard input stream and rely solely on the arguments found after the command.

# find all file name ending with .pdf and remove them
find -name *.pdf | xargs rm -rf

# if file name contains spaces you should use this instead
find -name *.pdf | xargs -I{} rm -rf '{}'

# Will show every .pdf like:
#	&toto.pdf=
#	&titi.pdf=
# -n1 => One file by one file. ( -n2 => 2 files by 2 files )

find -name *.pdf | xargs -I{} -n1 echo '&{}='
