# About su
# The Unix command su, sometimes described as substitute user, super user, or switch user, is used by a computer user to execute commands with the privileges of another user account. 
# When executed it invokes a shell without changing the current working directory or the user environment.
# When the command is used without specifying the new user id as a command line argument, 
# it defaults to using the superuser account (user id 0) of the system.
