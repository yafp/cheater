# About markdown
# Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. 
# It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats 
# using a tool by the same name.
# Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online 
# discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. 
# As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered 
# questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over 
# the years to answer these issues.
