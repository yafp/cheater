# About more

# text file one screen at a time. 
# It is available on Unix and Unix-like systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft 
# Windows. 
# Programs of this sort are called pagers. more is a very basic pager, 
# originally allowing only forward navigation through a file, though newer 
# implementations do allow for limited backward movement.
